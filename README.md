### Sedex Connect - Tech Test Fullstack

This is an example technical test for a full stack developer. It aims to give the interviewee the opportunity to show 
their knowledge by implementing the `POST /company` method of the [open api spec](./companies-openapi3.yaml) 
in either the frontend OR the backend 

If you choose the to implement frontend please do so in React, feel free to use whatever libs to assist your implementation:
- Create a page that will allow a user to submit a company via a form and display the response.

If you choose to implement the backend please do Kotlin, feel free to use whatever libs to assist your implementation.
- Expose the endpoint as a Restful HTTP service returning a JSON response as per the api spec.

We are looking for clean and tested code with instructions on how to run the application locally. 

The project can be organised you see fit, however we do ask that all the code required to run the solution is 
submitted to a publicly accessible VCS of your choice for us to review.

Please time box the exercise to  a maximum of two hours. If you can complete all of the exercise in that time 

Thanks!
