### Sedex Connect - Fullstack Tech Test

This is an example technical test for a full stack developer. ðŸ’»

It aims to give the interviewee the opportunity to show their knowledge by implementing the `POST /company` 
method of the [open api spec](./companies-openapi3.yaml) in either the frontend OR the backend. 

If you choose the to implement frontend please do so in React, feel free to use whatever libs to assist your 
implementation but please include the dependencies in the build tool:
- Create a page that will allow a user to submit a company via a form and display the response.
- You can use the following endpoint to implement against: 

If you choose to implement the backend please do Kotlin, feel free to use whatever libs to assist your implementation 
but please include the dependencies in the build tool.
- Expose the endpoint as a Restful HTTP service consuming and returning a JSON response as per the api spec.
- Due to time constraints we suggest you use an in memory persistence layer

We are looking for clean and tested code with instructions on how to run the application locally. 

The project can be organised you see fit, however we do ask that all the code required to run the solution is 
submitted to a publicly accessible VCS of your choice for us to review.

Please time box the exercise to  a hour and a half maximum. Git commits would be appreciated to show the solutions 
evolution. 

If you cant implement the full POST company specification in an hour and a half, dont worry, just put down a few steps 
that you would go on to implement to complete the spec and the time you estimate that it would take to complete.

Thanks! ðŸ˜ƒ
