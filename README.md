### Sedex Connect - Tech Test FullStack

This is an example technical test for a full stack developer. It aims to give the interviewee the opportunity to show 
their knowledge of full stack development. We do not restrict your choice of technology, use whatever you want to 
get the job done. 

We are after a vertical slice in functionality, a frontend, calling a backend service API, with tests. 
We are after the simplest means of doing so. 

The functionality we are after:

* Implement the company api spec in the backend service.
    * Use an in memory persistence layer
* Implement a frontend to call the backend API.
    * A simple form with a field to capture the Id and button to call the GET /companies/id
    * Display the returned company details
* Testing of both FE and BE and possible integration tests
* Either deploy remotely or provide instructions on how to run locally.


Generally we use the following tech stack:

- React JS
- Java/Kotlin Backend services
- Docker
- Bitbucket pipelines
- AWS, EKS


The projects can be organised you see fit, however we do ask that all the code required to run the solution is 
submitted to version control for us to review.

Please time box the exercise to an hour and half.
